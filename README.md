# AI SDK Lab

Quick-start examples for the Vercel AI SDK, kept small so you can copy, run, and adapt.

## Examples

- `streaming-to-a-ui/` – Next.js 16 chat UI that streams Anthropic responses via the AI SDK, with a pirate-flavored system prompt.

## Getting started

1) Choose an example folder.  
2) Install deps with `pnpm install` (or your preferred npm client).  
3) Add required env vars noted in that example’s README.  
4) Run `pnpm dev` to start the local server.

More examples coming soon.
